		The Potato Leaf Blight Detection project leverages the power of Machine Learning (ML) to
		accurately identify whether a potato leaf is affected by blightâ€”a destructive disease caused by
		fungal pathogens like Phytophthora infestans. Blight can lead to significant crop losses if not
		detected early, making rapid and reliable diagnosis critical for farmers and agricultural
		stakeholders. This innovative solution utilizes advanced image recognition algorithms trained on
		a diverse dataset of healthy and infected potato leaf images. By analyzing visual features such
		as color, texture, and patterns of lesions, the model can classify leaves with high precision.
		The system is designed to be user-friendly and accessible, with potential integration into
		mobile applications, allowing farmers to capture and analyze leaf images directly from their
		fields. The project aims to reduce reliance on manual inspections, promote early intervention,
		and contribute to sustainable agricultural practices. With its scalable and efficient approach,
		this ML-powered tool empowers farmers to protect their crops, minimize losses, and enhance food
		security.
